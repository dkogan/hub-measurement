This is a tool for measuring the hub spacing in a bicycle wheel. There are
several common standards for rear hubs, and this makes it easy to quickly figure
out what kind of hub we have. Common standards are described on [[https://www.sheldonbrown.com/frame-spacing.html][Sheldon Brown's
page]].

Use this tool like this:

Here we have a 135mm hub.

The [[hub-measurement.slvs][final design]] was made in [[https://solvespace.com/index.pl][solvespace]]. The .svg ready to be cut:

Here I cut the text at half-depth.

A [[hub-measurement.FCStd][version of the design]] was made using [[https://www.freecad.org/][FreeCAD]] as well; this had trouble
exporting the text in a usable way. An [[separate-pieces/][earlier design]] was made to produce a
different measurement bracket for each hub size.
