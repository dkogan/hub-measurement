This is a tool for measuring the hub spacing in a bicycle wheel. There are

The [[hub-measurement.slvs][final design]] was made in [[https://solvespace.com/index.pl][solvespace]]:

A [[hub-measurement.FCStd][version of the design]] was made using [[https://www.freecad.org/][FreeCAD]] as well. An [[separate-pieces/][earlier design]] was
made to produce a different measurement bracket for each hub size.
